<!--Summary-->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    I am a self taught developer with a background in the NHS as a Paramedic then laterly, a Senior Programme Manager for Virtual Wards. 
    I joined the Military as a Royal Engineer, living across the UK and Europe building physical engineering skills and a great foundation 
    in leadership and human factors.</p>
    <p>I left to re-train as a Paramedic and quickly progressed through the ranks ending up in Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response 
    in a Strategic and Tactical advisor role. I left the Ambulance service to work in the wider NHS system as a Senior programme manager to 
    implement a regional Virtual Ward Service. This is what struck my interest in the digital space, it has been great to work with these new 
    and developing tech companies. I would love to work on building software like this to enable top quality patient care in their own home.
